    <h1>My Personal Concerns with Eastern Orthodoxy</h1>
    <div id="body-container">
      <p>
        The following document is a list of my personal concerns regarding
        Eastern Orthodoxy. I am a protestant that is seeking Christ in truth,
        but that doesn't ensure that I am without bias. If there are any
        elements of this document that are incorrect or misleading, please
        correct me.

        Orthodoxy and articulate them.

      <h2>They Claim Infallible, Conscience-Binding Universal Authority</h2>
      <p>
        The formally held canonical positions of the Eastern Orthodox Church are
        legally binding on the conscience of those who join the Church (though
        they may not be expressly taught in local congregations).
      </p>
      <p>Why? Because...</p>
      <h3>The Church Claims that the Church Cannot Make Mistakes or Deceive</h3>
      <p>
        I will be drawing some attention to the synodically received
        <a
          href="https://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Jerusalem Council of 1672
        </a>
        throughout this document.
      </p>

      <p>
        Presided over by the Patriarch Dositheus, this council, being
        Pan-Orthodox and received without any meaningful rejection, is held as
        binding, authoritative and infallible.
      </p>

      <h4>The Council of Jerusalem 1672, Decree II:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        Wherefore, the witness also of the Catholic Church is, we believe, not
        of inferior authority to that of the Divine Scriptures. For one and the
        same Holy Spirit being the author of both, it is quite the same to be
        taught by the Scriptures and by the Catholic Church. Moreover, when any
        man speaketh from himself he is liable to err, and to deceive, and be
        deceived; but the Catholic Church, as never having spoken, or speaking
        from herself, but from the Spirit of God — who being her teacher, she is
        ever unfailingly rich —
        <span class="bold"
          >it is impossible for her to in any wise err, or to at all deceive, or
          be deceived; but like the Divine Scriptures, is infallible, and hath
          perpetual authority.</span
        >

      <h2>Not Orthodox? Not Saved</h2>
      <p>
        The Eastern Orthodox church formally holds that you are not saved if you
        are not Orthodox.
      </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate this point, I will be drawing from
        <a
          href="https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/02/synodicon-of-orthodoxy.html"
          target="_blank"
          >The Synodikon of Orthodoxy</a
        >, a text heavily associated with the decisions of the Seventh
        Ecumenical Council. It is to be annually read on the Sunday of
        Orthodoxy, the first Sunday of Lent.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the titles of the Feast Day on which it is read, it is clearly
        being associated with the very identity of Eastern Orthodox
        Christianity, and of what it means to be an Eastern Orthodox Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Synodikon clearly addresses all who are not in the Eastern Church in
        the section from 1583, signed by the three chiefest Patriarchs, of
        Constantinople (and so Russia by inclusion for at the time it was a
        Metropolia under Constantinople), Alexandria, and Jerusalem,
        respectively:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        That
        <span class="bold">
          whoever does not confess with heart and mind that he is a child of the
          Eastern Church baptized in Orthodox style</span
        >, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds out of only the Father, essentially
        and hypostatically, as Christ says in the Gospel, shall be outside our
        Church and shall be <span class="bold">anathematized</span>.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Concerning communion:</p>
      <blockquote>
        That
        <span class="bold">whoever says that our Lord Jesus Christ</span> at the
        Mystic Supper <span class="bold">had unleavened bread</span> (made
        without yeast), like that of the Jews, and not leavened bread, that is
        to say, bread raised with yeast, let him depart far from us and let him
        be <span class="bold">anathema</span> as one having Jewish views and
        those of Apolinarios and bringing dogmas of the Armenians into our
        Church, on which account let him be
        <span class="bold">doubly anathema</span>.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Concerning calendars:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="bold">That whoever does not follow the customs</span> of
        the Church as the Seven Holy Ecumenical Councils decreed, and Holy
        Pascha, and the Menologion (an ecclesiastical calendar prescribing
        feastdays and fasting periods) with which they did well in making it a
        law that we should follow it, and wishes to follow the newly-invented
        Paschalion and the New Menologion (i.e. the Gregorian calendar) of the
        atheist astronomers of the Pope, and opposes all those things and wishes
        to overthrow and destroy the dogmas and customs of the Church which have
        been handed down by our fathers,
        <span class="bold">
          let him suffer anathema and be put out of the Church of Christ and out
          of the congregation of the Faithful </span
        >.
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, according to the Synodikon, you cannot be saved if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aren’t part of the orthodox church</li>
        <li>Believe Jesus ate leavened bread at The Last Supper</li>
        <li>Disagree about the calendar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lastly, The Seventh Ecumenical Council speaks of those who refuse to bow
        down and kiss icons with affection. as <q>God forsaken</q> and
        <q>God-hated heretics</q>.
        <cite
          >Session VI, The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd Series, Vol.
          14,p. 572, 573, and 542.</cite
        >
        This is clearly a serious condemnation of every professing Christian
        that refuses to bow down and kiss icons.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Does Anathema Really Mean Hell?</h2>
      <p>
        Some may be inclined to say that an anathema is less severe than being
        sent straight to hell. Let me explain how the Orthodox church defines
        anathema.
      </p>
      <h4>The Seventh Ecumenical Council:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        “Now anathema is nothing less than complete separation from God”
        <br /><br />
        <cite
          >Second Nicaea, "The Letter from the Synod to the Emperor and
          Empress", from The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd Series, Vol.
          14, p. 573</cite
        >
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        An Orthodox Canon Law Reference Book describes an anathema as
        <q>the most severe ecclesiastical sanction</q> where
        <q> the guilty person is cut off from the Church and from salvation </q>
        <cite
          >(compiled by Fr. Vasile Mihai, Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2014; pg
          49)</cite
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He continues by stating:
        <q>
          Anathema is parallel to the death penalty in secular society, as
          spiritual death is seen by the Church as analogous to physical
          death.</q
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice, these anathemas are not calls to repentance. They are a judicial
        sentencing followed by their corresponding judgments.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Canon XIII (in this instance dealing with those who misuse monastic
        properties) from the Seventh Ecumenical Council states, to be
        “excommunicated” is to be:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        condemned from the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and assigned
        their place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched...
        <br /><br /><cite
          >The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd Series, Vol. 14, p.
          564.</cite
        >
      </blockquote>

      <hr />

      <h2>Not Christ's Righteousness That Justifies</h2>
      <h3>
        The righteousness you possess and maintain by virtue of your works
        justifies you before God
      </h3>
      <h4>The Council of Jerusalem 1672, Decree IX:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        We believe no one to be saved without faith. And by faith we mean the
        <span class="bold">right notion</span> that is in us concerning God and
        divine things, which, working by love, that is to say, by [observing]
        the Divine commandments, justifieth us with Christ; and without this
        [faith] it is impossible to please God.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Essentially, saving faith is reduced to having and affirming the right
        information (notion), not a reliant trust in and on Christ. It's more a
        <span class="italic">belief about</span>
        rather than a <span class="italic">belief in</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After defining faith as notional, it adds works. So, salvation = right
        information + works.
      </p>
      <h4>The Council of Jerusalem 1672, Decree XIII</h4>
      <blockquote>
        We believe a man to be not simply justified through faith alone, but
        through faith which worketh through love, that is to say, through faith
        and works. But [the notion] that faith fulfilling the function of a hand
        layeth hold on the righteousness which is in Christ, and applieth it
        unto us for salvation, we know to be far from all Orthodoxy. For faith
        so understood would be possible in all, and so none could miss
        salvation, which is obviously false.
        <span class="underline">
          But on the contrary, we rather believe that it is
          <span class="bold"> not the correlative of faith </span>, but the
          faith which is in us, justifieth through works, with Christ. But
          <span class="bold"> we regard works </span> not as witnesses
          certifying our calling, but as being fruits in themselves, through
          which faith becometh efficacious, and
          <span class="bold">as in themselves meriting</span>, through the
          Divine promises {cf. 2 Corinthians 5:10} that
          <span class="bold">
            each of the Faithful may receive what is done through his own body </span
          >, whether it be good or bad...
        </span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What is the correlative of faith spoken of here? It is Jesus Christ and
        <span class="bold">his</span> righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        This understanding is confirmed when we note that Decithius is
        responding to Cyril Lucaris’ claim that the correlative of faith is the
        righteousness of Christ. As the confession attributed to Lucaris states:
        “but when we say 'by faith' we understand the correlative or object of
        Faith which is the righteousness of Christ”. According to Lucaris, then,
        it is the righteousness of Christ which justifies -
        <span class="bold">
          a righteousness which is received by faith as faith’s
          <span class="italic">correlative</span> </span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Eastern Orthodox Church expressly denies that Christ's righteousness
        justifies a person. The righteousness of Christ, and even Christ
        himself, is not sufficient to justify according to Eastern Orthodox
        canonical theology, but are insufficient and must be added to. In their
        doctrine, faith justifies <span class="italic">through works</span> with
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, works are <span class="bold">meritorious</span>. The
        faith they speak of is more like a personal virtue, since it's not the
        correlative of faith that justifies. Instead, it's the faith a person
        possesses by the exercise of their own natural ability to have faith,
        like when a person is loyal, that enables works to become meirtorious.
        So, it is a kind of loyalty to the
        <span class="italic">information</span> about Jesus
        <span class="bold">plus one's works</span> that justifies a person with
        Christ.
      </p>

      <h2>Icon Veneration is Clearly an Accretion</h2>
      <p>
        I won't go too in-depth on this point, though I find it to be the final
        and most glaring evidence that the Orthodox Church isn't historic.
        Instead, I will refer you to this
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ytYX4dXpRo" target="_blank"
          >video</a
        >
        by Pastor Gavin Ortlund (also linked below). I believe it contains clear
        and compelling evidence that
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniconism#:~:text=Aniconism%20is%20the%20cultural%20absence,of%20certain%20figures%20in%20religions."
          target="_blank"
          >Aniconism</a
        >
        was the resounding and universal testimony of the early church.
      </p>
      <p>Just as a primer, My favorite example outlined in the video is:</p>
      <h4>
        Epiphanius Bishop of Salamis (born AD 310) writing to John of Jerusalem.
      </h4>

      <blockquote>
        Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against
        me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to
        join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came
        to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning
        there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went
        in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said
        church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of
        one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing
        this, and
        <span class="bold">
          being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ’s church
          contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures,
        </span>
        I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a
        winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said
        that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should
        give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I
        promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once.
        Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have
        been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of
        the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have
        now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the
        presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the
        hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that
        curtains of the other sort—opposed as they are to our religion—shall not
        be hung up in any church of Christ.
        <span class="bold">
          A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of
          offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians
          who are committed to your charge.
