    <h1>My Personal Concerns with Orthodoxy</h1>

    <p>
      The formally held canonical positions of the EO Church are legitimately
      binding on the conscience of those who join the Church (though they may
      not be expressly taught in local congregations).
    </p>

    <p>
      Why? Because they hold church tradition and scripture as equally
      infallible, inerrant, and binding. (<a href="URL_HERE">see here</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
      The EO church formally holds that you are not saved if you are not
      orthodox. Specifically, you cannot be saved if you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Aren’t part of the orthodox church (<a href="URL_HERE">see here</a>)
      </li>
      <li>Use leavened bread in communion (<a href="URL_HERE">see here</a>)</li>
      <li>Use the wrong feast calendar (<a href="URL_HERE">see here</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>ANATHEMA LINK</strong> (anathema means nothing less than
      separation from God in Hell)
    </p>

    <p>
      The EO church formally holds that you are saved by the right information
      about Jesus plus obedience to divine commandments. (<a href="URL_HERE"
        >see here</a
      >)
    </p>

    <p>
      The EO church formally holds that Christ’s righteousness does not justify
      you before God. It is your works that justify you, with Christ, because
      they merit what you deserve (either good or bad). (<a href="URL_HERE"
        >see here</a
      >)
    </p>

    <h2>Icon Veneration is Clearly an Accretion</h2>

    <p>
      At Nicea II, the council anathematized to hell the resounding witness of
      the apostolic and early church fathers. That is, “to those who do not kiss
      the holy and venerable images: anathema.”
    </p>

    <p>
      See Video @8:36 for anathema:

    <p>
      Orthodox canonical positions are authoritatively established in their own
      universally accepted councils (2)
    </p>

    <h3>
      CONTEXT: The Council of Jerusalem of 1672 - a universally received local
      council, meaning that it is held as bindingly authoritative and
      infallible.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (A local Council that is universally received is therefore universally
      binding.)
    </p>
    <p>Presided over by the Patriarch Dositheus.</p>

    <p>The Church Claims that the Church Cannot Make Mistakes or Deceive</p>
    <p>Council of Jerusalem of 1672, Decree II:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Wherefore, the witness also of the Catholic Church is, we believe, not
        of inferior authority to that of the Divine Scriptures. For one and the
        same Holy Spirit being the author of both, it is quite the same to be
        taught by the Scriptures and by the Catholic Church. Moreover, when any
        man speaketh from himself he is liable to err, and to deceive, and be
        deceived; but the Catholic Church, as never having spoken, or speaking
        from herself, but from the Spirit of God — who being her teacher, she is
        ever unfailingly rich — it is impossible for her to in any wise err, or
        to at all deceive, or be deceived; but like the Divine Scriptures, is
        infallible, and hath perpetual authority. (1)
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Essentially: Councils are equal to scripture</p>

    <p>The Church Claims you are not saved if you are not Orthodox</p>
    <p>Council of Jerusalem of 1672, Decree X:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        the dignity of the Bishop is so necessary in the Church, that without
        him, neither Church nor Christian could either be or be spoken of.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Synodikon of Orthodoxy</h2>

    <p>
      Supposed to be read yearly on the Feast of Orthodoxy. From the titles of
      the Feast Day on which it is read, it is clearly being associated with the
      very identity of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and of what it means to be
      an Eastern Orthodox Christian. It is celebrated on the first Sunday of
      Great Lent in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially associated with the Seventh Ecumenical Council, which defines
      the meaning of anathema (<a href="URL_HERE"
        >see more on what anathema means</a
      >).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Synodikon clearly states in the section from 1583, signed by the three
      chiefest Patriarchs, of Constantinople (and so Russia by inclusion for at
      the time it was a Metropolia under Constantinople), Alexandria, and
      Jerusalem, respectively, concerning all who are not in the Eastern Church:
    </p>

    <p><em>Not Orthodox, Not Saved - The Synodikon</em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “That whoever does not confess with heart and mind that he is a child of
        the Eastern Church baptized in Orthodox style, and that the Holy Spirit
        proceeds out of only the Father, essentially and hypostatically, as
        Christ says in the Gospel, shall be outside our Church and shall be
        anathematized.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In other words, not being in the Orthodox Church, and affirming the
      filioque, means that you are consistently and formally cursed to perdition
      by the Eastern Orthodox Church.
