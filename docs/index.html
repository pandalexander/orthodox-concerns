I am a protestant that is seeking Christ in truth, but that doesn't ensure that I am without bias. If there are any elements of this document that are incorrect or misleading, please correct me. <a href="mailto:ruby.sawfly5328@eagereverest.com">Click to Email me!</a></p><p>Additionally, I have benefitted <span class="bold">greatly</span> from the work of <a href="https://youtube.com/@pastorjoshuaschooping4702?si=MItHPQX5e_G9aArp" target="_blank">Pastor Joshua Schooping</a> and <a href="https://truthunites.org/" target="_blank">Pastor Gavin Ortlund</a>. This entire document is distilled from their diligent work, so please take this comment as a universal copyright attribution to them both. Though church history is open for everyone to see, their particular work (linked at the bottom) is what allowed me to see the concerning parts of Orthodoxy and articulate them.</p><p>All Glory to Jesus Christ Alone.</p><hr/><h2>They Claim Infallible, Conscience-Binding Universal Authority</h2><p>The formally held canonical positions of the Eastern Orthodox Church are legally binding on the conscience of those who join the Church (though they may not be expressly taught in local congregations).</p><p>Why? Because...</p><h3>The Church Claims that the Church Cannot Make Mistakes or Deceive</h3><p>I will be drawing some attention to the synodically received <a href="https://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html" target="_blank">Jerusalem Council of 1672 </a>throughout this document.</p><p>Presided over by the Patriarch Dositheus, this council, being Pan-Orthodox and received without any meaningful rejection, is held as binding, authoritative and infallible.</p><h4>The Council of Jerusalem 1672, Decree II:</h4><blockquote>Wherefore, the witness also of the Catholic Church is, we believe, not of inferior authority to that of the Divine Scriptures. For one and the same Holy Spirit being the author of both, it is quite the same to be taught by the Scriptures and by the Catholic Church. Moreover, when any man speaketh from himself he is liable to err, and to deceive, and be deceived; but the Catholic Church, as never having spoken, or speaking from herself, but from the Spirit of God — who being her teacher, she is ever unfailingly rich — <span class="bold">it is impossible for her to in any wise err, or to at all deceive, or be deceived; but like the Divine Scriptures, is infallible, and hath perpetual authority.</span></blockquote><hr/><h2>Not Orthodox? Not Saved</h2><p>The Eastern Orthodox church formally holds that you are not saved if you are not Orthodox.</p><p>To illustrate this point, I will be drawing from <a href="https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/02/synodicon-of-orthodoxy.html" target="_blank">The Synodikon of Orthodoxy</a>, a text heavily associated with the decisions of the Seventh Ecumenical Council. It is to be annually read on the Sunday of Orthodoxy, the first Sunday of Lent.</p><p>From the titles of the Feast Day on which it is read, it is clearly being associated with the very identity of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and of what it means to be an Eastern Orthodox Christian.</p><p>The Synodikon clearly addresses all who are not in the Eastern Church in the section from 1583, signed by the three chiefest Patriarchs, of Constantinople (and so Russia by inclusion for at the time it was a Metropolia under Constantinople), Alexandria, and Jerusalem, respectively:</p><blockquote>That <span class="bold">whoever does not confess with heart and mind that he is a child of the Eastern Church baptized in Orthodox style</span>, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds out of only the Father, essentially and hypostatically, as Christ says in the Gospel, shall be outside our Church and shall be <span class="bold">anathematized</span>.</blockquote><p>Concerning communion:</p><blockquote>That <span class="bold">whoever says that our Lord Jesus Christ</span> at the Mystic Supper <span class="bold">had unleavened bread</span> (made without yeast), like that of the Jews, and not leavened bread, that is to say, bread raised with yeast, let him depart far from us and let him be <span class="bold">anathema</span> as one having Jewish views and those of Apolinarios and bringing dogmas of the Armenians into our Church, on which account let him be <span class="bold">doubly anathema</span>.</blockquote><p>Concerning calendars:</p><blockquote><span class="bold">That whoever does not follow the customs</span> of the Church as the Seven Holy Ecumenical Councils decreed, and Holy Pascha, and the Menologion (an ecclesiastical calendar prescribing feastdays and fasting periods) with which they did well in making it a law that we should follow it, and wishes to follow the newly-invented Paschalion and the New Menologion (i.e. the Gregorian calendar) of the atheist astronomers of the Pope, and opposes all those things and wishes to overthrow and destroy the dogmas and customs of the Church which have been handed down by our fathers, <span class="bold">let him suffer anathema and be put out of the Church of Christ and out of the congregation of the Faithful </span>.</blockquote><p>So, according to the Synodikon, you cannot be saved if you:</p><ul><li>Aren’t part of the orthodox church</li><li>Use leavened bread in communion</li><li>Use the wrong calendar</li></ul><hr/><h2>Faith = Right Information, not Trust</h2><p>The EO church formally holds that you are saved by the right information about Jesus plus obedience to divine commandments. (see here)</p><hr/><h2>Not Christ's Righteousness</h2><p>The EO church formally holds that Christ’s righteousness does not justify you before God. It is your works that justify you, with Christ, because they merit what you deserve (either good or bad). (see here)</p><hr/><h2>Icon Veneration is Clearly an Accretion</h2><p>The formally held canonical positions of the EO Church are legitimately binding on the conscience of those who join the Church (though they may not be expressly taught in local congregations).</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ytYX4dXpRo?si=EvubHx1VB4I2feuk&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><hr/><div id="source-container"><h2>Sources</h2><p><a href="https://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html" target="_blank">The Council of Jerusalem 1672</a></p><p><a href="https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2022/12/21/the-delayed-synodical-receptions-of-the-councils-of-jasy-1642-and-jerusalem-1672/" target="_blank">The Reception of The Council of Jerusalem 1672</a></p><p><a href="https://thereformedninja.blogspot.com/2022/11/eastern-orthodoxy-and-ritual-cursing-of.html" target="_blank">Eastern Orthodoxy and The Ritual Cursing of All Other Christians</a></p><p><a href="https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/02/synodicon-of-orthodoxy.html" target="_blank">The Synodikon of Orthodoxy</a></p></div><script defer="defer" src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
